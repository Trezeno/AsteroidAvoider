# AsteroidAvoider
Small game coded using pygame in which you control a spaceship and dodge asteroids to gain score.
Built with the aid of some assets taken from pygame tutorials, others drawn by myself with the aid of aseprite.

### Gameplay
You are the commander of a spaceship who has been tasked with navigating a never-ending asteroid field. Your mission is simple, survive as long as you can!

You will, as your score increases, be rewarded with more ammunition and health, if you can grab it in time.

But be warned, as you fly deeping into the asteroid field, the asteroids will have a much greater velocity and be much more numerous!

### Useful Keys
- Use 'WASD' to move your ship Up, Left, Down, Right respectively.
- Use 'SPACEBAR' to shoot missiles
- Use 'ESC' or 'P' to pause the game at any point

### Extra notes
- There is currently no sound, to be implemented at another time.
- There is currently no way to save progress and/or a leaderboard.
- The game is (for now) made using pygame rectangles and not sprites. As a result, collision may seem a bit strange, especially between spaceship and asteroid. Just do your best! It is my first attempt after all.
- There are 4 listed asteroid images, however, for now it is just set to display the same one until I implement a change to this.
- The game will abruptly end and close itself after 5s of displaying the Game Over screen.

Otherwise, have fun and enjoy!
