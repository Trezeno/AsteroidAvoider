# AsteroidAvoider
Small game coded using pygame in which you control a spaceship and dodge asteroids to gain score.
Built with the aid of some assets taken from pygame tutorials, others drawn by myself with the aid of aseprite.

## Gameplay
You control a spaceship and use 'WASD' to move your ship around.
The aim of the game is to shoot or dodge asteroids and increase your game score.
As your game score increases, so too does the speed and number of asteroids.
However, you will also be rewarded with ammo and health packs every so often at score thresholds.

### Extra notes
Here below is a list of extra notes that may be of importance:
- There is currently no sound, to be implemented at another time.
- There is currently no way to save progress and/or a leaderboard.
- The game will abruptly end and close itself after 5s of displaying the Game Over screen.
Otherwise, have fun and enjoy!
